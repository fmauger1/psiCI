    "# psiCI: a configuration-interaction module using Psi4 with DFT/HF orbitals\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `psiCI` to perform configuration-interaction (CI) calculations with Psi4 using density-functional theory (DFT) and Hartree-Fock orbitals. The module enable CI calculations using arbitrary configuration space for the CI expansion. It also provides support for building the configuration space associated with common active space (single- and multi-reference CIS(D) and RAS). `psiCI` is a Python class.\n",

    "\n",
    "We consider an atomic or molecular system with $N$ active electrons, described by the Hamiltonian operator (in atomic units unless otherwise specified)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\mathcal{H}} = -\\sum_{k=1}^{N}{\\frac{\\Delta_k}{2}}+\\sum_{k=1}^{N}{V_\\text{ne}({\\bf r}_k)} + \\sum_{1\\leq k < l\\leq N}{V_\\text{ee}({\\bf r}_k-{\\bf r}_l)}, \\quad\\quad\\quad (1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V_\\text{ne}$ is the total electron-nucleus interaction potential, *i.e.*, the atomic or molecular potential, and $V_\\text{ee}({\\bf r})=-\\frac{1}{|{\\bf r}|}$ is the Coulomb-repulsion potential between electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point for `psiCI` calculations is a DFT or HF set of spatial orbitals $\\{\\phi_k\\}_k$, obtained after running a restricted ground-state calculation with `Psi4`. For each spatial orbital, we form two spin orbitals $\\chi_{k^\\prime}({\\bf x})=\\phi_k({\\bf r})\\alpha({\\omega})$ and $\\chi_{k^{\\prime\\prime}}({\\bf x})=\\phi_k({\\bf r})\\beta({\\omega})$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ designate up and down spins, respectively. Then, selecting a set of $N$ spin-orbital indexes $\\vec{k}=\\{k_1,k_2,\\ldots,k_N\\}$, we can form the configuration state associated with their Slater determinant as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |\\chi_\\vec{k}\\rangle = |\\chi_{k_1} \\chi_{k_2} \\ldots \\chi_{k_N}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_N}{\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)\\prod_{l=1}^{N}{\\chi_{\\sigma(k_l)}({\\bf x}_{k_l})}}, \\quad\\quad\\quad (2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S_N$ is the group of permutations in $[1,N]$. The CI calculation then corresponds to projecting the wave functions and Hamiltonian operator of equation (1) into a basis of configuration states. Specifically, upon calculating the CI matrix with elements $H_{\\vec{k}\\vec{k}^\\prime}=\\langle\\chi_\\vec{k}|\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}|\\chi_{\\vec{k}^\\prime}\\rangle$, its eigen avlues and vectors define the electronic energies and multi-Slater-determinant wave function for the ground and excited state, in the configuration state basis.\n",
